Description: This package offers a suite of tools for logistic regression analysis, 
    tailored for robust model fitting and evaluation. It features log loss 
    optimization for parameter estimation, bootstrap methods for confidence 
    interval calculation, and functions for generating logistic plots. Users can 
    also compute and visualize confusion matrices to assess model performance. 
    These tools are designed to enhance the interpretability and reliability of 
    logistic regression models in various research and applied data analysis domains.
